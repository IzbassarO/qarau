# devteam

Qarau's multi-agent dev team on LangGraph. Dev tooling, not part of the product.
Plan and rules: `docs/notes/devteam-plan.md`, CLAUDE.md → "Delivery".

**No human review.** Each task runs on `devteam/<task>`, becomes a PR into `dev` (the review
packet is the description) and is merged automatically only when every gate is green:
local checks, tester judge, GitHub CI, no benchmark regression, clean secret scan
(gitleaks). Otherwise it goes back to the developer (max 3 times), then `blocked`.
A red GitHub CI check sends back the last 150 lines of `gh run view <id> --log-failed`
(in the packet and in the developer's feedback), not just a link.
`dev` → `main` is a weekly release PR, merged only if CI and the full benchmark are green.

```bash
cd devteam && uv sync          # also needs: gitleaks (brew install gitleaks), gh, claude, codex
uv run devteam run             # brain plans, developers build, tester + gates decide, auto-merge
uv run devteam stop            # from any terminal: stop everything now (agents, checks, CI wait)
uv run devteam resume          # continue after stop, crash, usage limit or budget cap
uv run devteam status          # backlog with PR links / blocked reasons
uv run devteam report          # writes devteam/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md
uv run devteam release         # dev -> main now (also runs automatically every 7 days)
uv run devteam costs           # API spend per day / agent / model
uv run devteam cleanup         # remove leftover worktrees of done/dropped tasks
uv run devteam run --fake      # whole flow with fake agents and a local fake GitHub, no cost
uv run pytest                  # tests, incl. gates, crash + resume, forbidden actions
```

- Developers, in parallel: `dev_pipeline` = Claude Code (`claude -p`, subscription token in
  `.env`), `dev_app` = Codex (`codex exec`, your saved ChatGPT login; `codex login` once; no
  API key is ever passed). Codex has no network in its sandbox: `setup` installs first.
- Benchmark: developers run only the quick set (`quick_only`); the full set runs at the merge
  gate and at release, cached per `pipeline/` tree; a task may set its own `quick_only`.
- Screenshots: any task whose criteria mention the viewer lists `routes`; the tester
  screenshots them (pipeline tasks: the viewer on the quick benchmark output). A missing
  screenshot fails the task even if the judge passed. Pipeline tasks also get `dev-*.png`: the
  same routes on dev's cached gate benchmark, so the tester can compare with dev.
- Dependencies: a task may list `depends_on: [ids]`. The brain never plans it until all of
  them are `done`; a `blocked` task whose dependencies are all done goes back to `todo` (pushed
  to `dev` like any status) when the last one merges, or at the next `devteam run`.
- Resume: a task whose `devteam/<id>` branch already exists (local or on the remote) and has
  commits `dev` lacks continues on that branch, with `dev` merged in (never rebased); the plan
  says so.
- Scratch: each task gets `.state/scratch/<id>/` outside its worktree for experiments and temp
  output; files a developer leaves outside its folders are reverted (the log shows only the
  count and top-level folders).
- Task status lives in `backlog.yaml` on `dev`, owned by devteam. When a task ends (PR merged
  → `done`, or `blocked`), the orchestrator commits its status fields (`status, owner, run,
  branch, pr, done_at`, `blocked_reason`) straight to `dev` as `backlog: P3 done (#18)`:
  built on a fresh `origin/dev`, retried on a race, never forced, never to `main`. The
  pre-push hook lets a push to `dev` through only if it fast-forwards and changes nothing but
  `devteam/backlog.yaml`. The main checkout, when on `dev`, is then fast-forwarded
  (`--autostash`, your local edits stay). Never reset `backlog.yaml` by hand.
- `devteam run` refuses to start while the backlog's status fields differ from `origin/dev`
  (it prints them; after a crash use `devteam resume`). The brain skips any task whose
  `devteam/<id>` branch is already merged into `dev`.
- A task is `done` only when this run's commits went through a PR that passed CI and was
  merged. A branch already merged with nothing new is blocked as "nothing to merge, already
  done", never marked done.
- Daily report: merged / blocked tasks, API cost, **subscription load per task** (rounds,
  minutes, tokens, ≈ API $), latest benchmark, last release.
- Models, budget, gates, developer folders and checks: `config.yaml`.
- Keys: `.env` (gitignored), template `.env.example`.
- Agents never push, merge or call `gh`; the orchestrator does, and refuses force-push,
  history rewrites, branch deletion and `--admin` (`graph.py` `_guard`, `gates.py`).
- `hooks/pre-push` (installed automatically): local stand-in for GitHub branch protection
  (no GitHub Pro); also refuses moving an existing tag.
- Every successful release is tagged `release-YYYY-MM-DD` on `main` and pushed. Roll back:
  `git checkout release-YYYY-MM-DD` to look; to restore `main`, open a PR that reverts to it
  (`git revert` of the release merge), never a force-push.
- Runtime state (checkpoints, worktrees, packets, benchmark cache, costs, event log):
  `.state/` (gitignored). Daily reports: `reports/` (gitignored, local).
